## Overview

The adapter for Potensic Atom series remote controller, the standard tripod bolt thread allows you to attach any thing you want.

The main purpose of the adapter is attaching a tablet holder, the hump on the right bottom side could fit into the hole on the remote controller of Atom series and make the adapter stable enough for tablet.

There are two version of bolt: 1/4"-20 UNC and 3/8"-16 UNC thread(ISO 1222:2010). 

Use and test with caution!

I can not guarantee the full compatibility of printed models, the use of all models in this project is at your own risk.

## Known Issues

Using a high precision SLA 3d printers is highly recommended, and make sure your 3D printer could print decent threads.

There are also few tricks to make it work for low precision printer:

- Print the 3/8" version and use a 3/8"-1/4" screw adapter.

- Modify the model and remove the thread yourself, then install a 3/8" or 1/4" nut.

Let me know if you found any other issues, I will try to fix it: shin.zheng@foxmail.com

Happy hacking.
