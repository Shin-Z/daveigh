# DAveiGh: **D**rone **A**ccessories and **G**adgets 3D Printed

This project is created by Shin ZHENG. Oct 10, 2023.

Currently maintained by [Shin ZHENG](shin.zheng@foxmail.com).

## Overview
DAveiGh contains multiple models of drone accessories and gadgets for 3d printing(mostly .stl files), i.e., lens hoods, filter holders.

Some accessories and gadgets are not exist on the market so I 3d-print them by myself !

The models are definitely not perfect, and the print quality also depends on the accuracy of 3d-printers.

Use and test with caution!

I can not guarantee the full compatibility of printed models, the use of all models in this project is at your own risk.

Let me know if you found any issues, I will try to fix it: shin.zheng@foxmail.com

Happy hacking.
